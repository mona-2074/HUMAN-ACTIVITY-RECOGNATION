# HUMAN-ACTIVITY-RECOGNiTION
This project focuses on developing a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using time-series sensor data.
This project explores the use of a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and bidirectional long short term memory for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using sensor data. The goal was to build a model that is not only accurate but also efficient enough to run on devices with limited computational power, such as smartphones or wearable tech. By focusing on a compact architecture with only a few convolutional layers, we aimed to reduce complexity while still capturing important patterns in the input data.
In this research paper a publicly available HAR dataset is been used that contains time-series data collected from smartphone sensors during various physical activities like walking, sitting, standing, and lying down etc. Before training, the data was carefully preprocessed and normalized, and is also experimented with basic augmentation techniques to improve the model's ability to generalize.
The model achieved solid classification accuracy across different activities while maintaining fast training and low resource usage. This shows that even lightweight CNNs can perform well for HAR tasks, making them practical for real-time applications in health monitoring, fitness tracking, and smart environments.
